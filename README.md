# Todo Node.JS Project

This project is basic guidelines for a Node.JS beginner.

## Objective:
* Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete(CRUD) for todo task.

## Technology used for development:
1. OS: [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)| Version 14.04
2. Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) | Version 3.4.10
3. Node.js web application: [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
4. Browser: [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)

*Please prefer the latest version as possible*
> Alternative OS and Browser can be used to run this app.

## Development
1. Understand MongoDB database
2. Create a basic Node project
3. Routing and HTML page rendering
4. Working with database
5. Page design with Twitter Bootstrap
6. API development

## Git branching
* Final app is in master branch
* For each task, branch name with pattern **DEV-_Task Number_**, like **DEV-1**

## Using Markdown files
* [mongodb.md](mongodb.md) to understand [DEV-1](https://github.com/shreeramneupane/todo_node/tree/DEV-1)
* [node_setup.md](mongodb.md) to understand [DEV-2](https://github.com/shreeramneupane/todo_node/tree/DEV-2)
* [routing.md](mongodb.md) to understand [DEV-3](https://github.com/shreeramneupane/todo_node/tree/DEV-3)
* [DEV-4](https://github.com/shreeramneupane/todo_node/tree/DEV-4) covers:
  * CRUD operation
  * templating with [pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug)
  
  so, understand both [database.md](database.md) and [pug.md](pug.md)

* It's time to refactor code, so read [refactor.md](refactor.md)
